After working in the veterinary field for over 20 years, it became obvious that one of the most daunting issues is training new teamates. This has become more pressing since the pandemic.

Clinics became overwhelmed with clients who are now working from home and around their pets 24/7. For better and for worse the demand soared. 

With the demand our ongoing issues with effective and efficient training were now at the forefront. Understaffed? Hire. Now that we have a new hire, how do we train them on the basics that are pertinent to this specific Hospital/Clinic? We can throw a large handbook at them and hope they will open it once in 6 months. Or we can introduce small bites of information, in this case regarding common medications, that they will be exposed to on a regular basis.  

This app was developed to solve that issue.

As these are the top prescribed medications in this practice it would make sense that an employee should get to know the basics of these meds.

Keeping the 'small bites' approach in mind, it is recommended that there are no more than 20 medications contained within the carousel.

I am hoping to expand it by including carousels with vaccinations carried, most common procedures, preventives that are carried as well as snippets of manuals and S.O.Ps.
