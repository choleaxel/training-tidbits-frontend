This app was developed to solve the neverending issues with training new staff in a Veterinary clinic. There is never enough time, and often too much information. 

This was developed with digesibility in mind. Small bites of important information pertaining to a specific clinic. 

As these are the top prescribed medications in this practice it would make sense that an employee should get to know the basics of these meds.

Keeping the 'small bites' approach in mind, it is recommended that there are no more than 20 medications contained within the carousel.

I am hoping to expand it by including carousels with vaccinations carried, most common procedures, preventives that are carried as well as snippets of manuals and S.O.Ps.
